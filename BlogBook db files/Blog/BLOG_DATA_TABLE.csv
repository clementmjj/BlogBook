165,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday tore into the Congress, terming its manifesto as a ""hypocrisy document"" which was ""full of lies"".
Addressing his second rally in Arunachal Pradesh within a week, the prime minister said the upcoming manifesto-full-Lok Sabha polls will be about the choice between ""trust and corruption, and about resolution and conspiracy"".
He charged that the Congress sympathises with those who insult India, and wondered whether its party symbol, the hand, is with the country or with those conspiring against it.
""Those who burn the Tricolour and insult it, raise slogans of breaking India into pieces, play in the hands of foreign forces and vandalise statues of Baba Saheb (Ambedkar), the Congress sympathises with them, too,"" Modi further charged.
Citing the Congress manifesto for the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Modi said it had promised that every house would have electricity by 2009.
""However, till 2014 around 18,000 villages in the country were unelectrified... Just like them (the Congress), their manifesto is corrupt and full of lies. Therefore, it should be called hypocrisy document, not a manifesto,"" Modi said.","Congress manifesto full of lies: PM Narendra Modi",03-APR-19 03.16.47.135000000 PM,0,0,"A","michellec"

Just a few metres away, tea stall owner Armugam proudly says he regularly attends Sanskrit classes, organised at the Mariyamma temple. While conversing with the locals, he uses Sanskrit words liberally. Close by is a primary school run by the government.
