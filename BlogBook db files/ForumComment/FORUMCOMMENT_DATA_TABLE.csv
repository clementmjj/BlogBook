173,03-APR-19 03.45.51.566000000 PM,"I honestly don't see what's wrong with it. If my brother committed a horrible crime, love for him might prompt me to help him cover it up or make excuses and allow him to continue doing it. Just because that action is based in love for my family doesn't make it moral.",171,"rose"
174,03-APR-19 03.46.06.309000000 PM,"I guess the problem is when some people think of 'loving God', they think of things like building churches or spending a lot of time praying or being generally pious. And yeah, if you put such things over the well being of your family I would think you were in the wrong. Whereas I see it more as being generally compassionate and doing what's right.",171,"maryj"
176,03-APR-19 03.46.36.170000000 PM,"There are a lot of writings not included in the Bible. For example... I think we all know what a boy's club the Vatican is, even though even the (canon) gospels mention that Jesus has female disciples.",171,"john"
178,03-APR-19 03.48.02.425000000 PM,"I'm willing to try just about everything except Surstrumming.

I also love anchovie pizza, especially since anchovies are considered to be too salty and oily by most people.",177,"maryj"
179,03-APR-19 03.48.09.702000000 PM,"The one thing I will not eat. Durian.",177,"sumanthl"
180,03-APR-19 03.48.19.505000000 PM,"I ate it half expecting I'd be one of the people able to enjoy it since I also enjoy fermented stinky tofu. I was glad to be right.

That said, it isn't something to be eaten often. It's not cheap and you gotta put it in the fridge for a little while before eating it. Still, I look forward to eating it again.

And while I ate my first serving of durian by itself, I've heard that it's even better when paired with other tropical fruits. It is called the ""king of fruits"", and what is a king without its subjects?",177,"rose"
182,03-APR-19 03.51.22.906000000 PM,"So this happened:

http://news.yahoo.com/yemens-government-says-foiled-al-qaida-plots-153746717.html

Yemen says it foiled a terrorist plot to attack important oil/natural gas areas in the south of the country.

Don't read the comments unless you won't to be angry, btw.",181,"michellec"
183,03-APR-19 03.51.28.180000000 PM,"Is it ok to discuss the effectiveness of US anti-terrorism policies? I've been seeing some news analysis questioning whether or not our drone attacks in Yemen are weakening Al Q or strengthening it.",181,"sumanthl"
184,03-APR-19 03.51.37.265000000 PM,"Now that you mention it, would non-AQ-linked terrorism around the world be on-topic too? Just curious.",181,"michaelj"
186,03-APR-19 03.52.13.651000000 PM,"I for one don't get the fad of being a ""Super Mom/Dad"" that's cropped up in the last 10-12 years. Why is being a spoiling, overprotective, thin-skinned nanny a good thing? I've seen far too many brats for kids to think that's a good parenting philosophy.",185,"john"
187,03-APR-19 03.52.21.553000000 PM,"No ome thinks its a good philosophy- its the result of a sense of ever more intense competition between parents to raise children who csn compete for limited opportunities more effectively.",185,"rose"
188,03-APR-19 03.52.45.052000000 PM,"I am not a parent, and am rather the recipient of parenting. Given the ability to raise a child of my own...? I wouldn't have a clue.

I am relatively well-adapted, at least compared to my rather bratty sister. I'm not going to offer some pithy one-liner about not molly-coddling my child, since I probably would. I would probably be a rather schizophrenic parent, meandering between ""I love my children"" and ""what if I'm a terrible parent and destroying their futureeee"".",185,"michellec"
190,03-APR-19 03.53.58.233000000 PM,"Yes, expired medications can be dangerous. There isn't one standard date of expiry, but it should be on the label somewhere (or on the various resources for the drug). It might be listed as a half-life.",189,"sumanthl"
191,03-APR-19 03.54.07.307000000 PM,"Half life? That indicates the time for something to become half of its original content, isn't it? How does it apply to drugs?",189,"rose"
192,03-APR-19 03.54.18.213000000 PM,"Not all compounds break down at the same rate and there will be statistical differences between it being made.",189,"maryj"
