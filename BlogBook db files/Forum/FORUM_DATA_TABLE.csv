I figured this was a shame since food is an important aspect of life and culture that helps people connect with each other. Plus, we kind of need it to live. So I figured, why not start a thread to let people here talk about food related topics?

I'll start things off by asking this: what is the most ""disgusting"" food you ever ate and enjoyed despite its reputation?

Personally, I've eaten things like organs including chicken testicles, stinky fermented tofu, and most recently durians. And I've enjoyed all of them. Especially the durian. Maybe I'm just one of the people who isn't bothered too much by the smell, but it really is just as good as its fans claim. The taste really is remniscient of almonds too. Now I want to try eating it in a cake or icecream.","Food and Food Culture","A","michaelj"

Religion is a volatile subject. Please don't post here if you can't manage a civil discussion with viewpoints you disagree with. There will be no tolerance for people who can't keep the tone light hearted.
There is no one true answer for this thread. Don't try to force out opposing voices.","The General Religion, Mythology, and Theology Thread","A","rose"
181,03-APR-19 03.51.10.855000000 PM,"So with the recent global terrorism alert I realised that we don't have a place to discuss such events as they happen and how they are being dealt with/reacted to.

First however I'd like to lay down a disclaimer, this is not a place to discuss the ethics of the ""war on terror"" it's for talking about current global threats, if you want to debate the ethics of the war on terror than make a thread for it, this is not the place.

So now I've done that, here's the latest as I'm aware of it. Normally I'd provide sources but I'm on my iPad so it's difficult to do so.

US embassies across the Great Middle East are closed until Saturday due to the current threat, the embassies of other western nations in Yeman have also been closed with staff being evacuated from the county.

Additionally a global travel alert has been issued for all US citizens, with US/UK citizens in Yeman being told to leave immediately.

Yeman's security services have been placing much of the country on lockdown, with the army out in force due to intelligence indicating that a large number of Al-Qa'ida operatives are in the country to work on the expected attack.

They (Yeman's security forces) have also just recently announced that they have foiled an attempt by AQ to blow up several oil pipelines and seize control of costal cities, howev they remain on high alert, so there is obviously more to come.","Global terrorism","A","sumanthl"

I like the smell of medicines that I'm allowed to smell. By the way, what are the average expiration period for medicines? One of my relatives works in a pharmacy and he says that it is very important to throw all the expired drugs because shit can go to hell if some of them were sold and consumed.","The Medical Thread","A","john"
